# Riaya (رعاية): a private front door to men's reproductive health

A privacy-first, Arabic-first pre-screen that helps men in Abu Dhabi understand and act on reproductive-health signals early. It routes each man to the right level of care, with a clinician approving every referral. It is built to plug into the IFHAS reproductive-health screening module.

## What's in it
- **Evidence graph** (`knowledge/graph.json`): 68 factors and 144 cause→effect links, each with an evidence grade (A–D) and a source (90+ references). It also holds 18 measurable signals (watch, phone, CGM, questionnaire, lab) with thresholds, and 8 red flags. The graph drives scoring and explanations, and is validated at server start.
- **Intake** in Arabic and English, using validated instruments: STOP-Bang, AUDIT-C, PHQ-2, PSS-4 and ADAM.
- **Device data**: Apple Health export (sleep, steps, HRV, SpO2, glucose, caffeine, alcohol), Dexcom/Libre CGM CSV, a generic daily CSV (Fitbit/Garmin/Health Connect/screen time), or manual entry. Raw files are never stored.
- **Test results**: interpreted against WHO 2021 reference limits, from a lab report, a quantitative smartphone device (YO-type) or a simple home test.
- **Explainability**: Shapley attribution over the evidence graph, a gradient-boosting model with a SHAP waterfall (simulated cohort with literature effect sizes), and a logistic model trained on real data (UCI Fertility, n=100) as a second opinion.
- **Triage**: deterministic, ordered rules, each citing its guideline. Red flags override everything. Clinician approval is required for specialist referrals.
- **Clinician console**: review queue, case explanation, approve/modify, booking and attendance tracking, outcome and fairness metrics, access log.
- **IFHAS hand-off**: FHIR R4 Bundle export.
- **Privacy**: no identity data, granular consent, encryption at rest, revocable share codes, delete/export, audit log.
- **Clothing check**: reads a care label (typed, or photographed with on-device OCR) and gives a groin-heat index with evidence-graded notes.

## Run it
```bash
